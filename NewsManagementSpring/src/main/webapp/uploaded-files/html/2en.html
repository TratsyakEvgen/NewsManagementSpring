	<p>Seoul, South Korea CNN — North Korea on Wednesday fired an
		intercontinental ballistic missile that flew for more than 70 minutes,
		Japan’s Defense Ministry said, marking a potential new round of
		confrontation with Washington and its allies.</p>
	<p>The 74-minute flight time represents a marginal advancement on
		the missiles tested by North Korea in March and April of this year,
		both of which were also ICBMs – weapons with the required range to
		potentially hit the continental United States.</p>
	<p>Wednesday’s launch, which landed in waters near to Japan, comes
		after Pyongyang earlier this week threatened to shoot down US military
		reconnaissance aircraft engaging in what it called “hostile espionage”
		activities near its territory.</p>
	<p>The missile launch and fiery rhetoric, while not unusual for
		Pyongyang, arrives during a period of heightened tensions on the
		peninsula, as Washington and Seoul ramp up their defense cooperation.
		It also appears timed to coincide with the NATO summit in Lithuania,
		where leaders from South Korea, Japan and the US are meeting to
		discuss security issues – including the threat posed by North Korea.</p>
	<p>The latest missile launch, the country’s first in three months,
		flew a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and at an altitude of
		over 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles), Japan’s Defense Ministry said.</p>
	<p>Flight times give an indication of a missile’s range. North
		Korea tests most of its missiles on a highly lofted trajectory so they
		splash down in nearby waters, rather than a flatter trajectory as
		would be used in an actual attack.</p>
	<p>Japan’s Coast Guard said earlier the missile was launched at
		9:59 a.m. local time and fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the
		East Sea, at 11:15 a.m., citing the Ministry of Defense.</p>
	<p>Some experts say North Korea likely tested its developmental,
		road-mobile Hwasong-18 ICBM, a type of solid-fuel weapon that is
		harder to detect and intercept than the North’s other liquid-fuel
		ICBMs. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un previously called the
		Hwasong-18 his most powerful nuclear weapon – though there is no
		indication the missile can successfully deliver a nuclear payload.</p>
	<p>“North Korea’s launch seems to be its second test of the
		Hwasong-18 ICBM which was first fired on April 13. North Korea seems
		to be continuously advancing the missile technology based on the first
		test launch result,” said Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University
		of North Korean Studies in Seoul.</p>
	<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held an emergency National
		Security Council meeting in Lithuania on Wednesday morning in response
		to the missile launch, Yoon’s press office said in a statement. Yoon
		is in Vilnius to attend the NATO summit.</p>
	<p>The South Korean leader said that he would call for “strong
		international solidarity” at the NATO summit in response to North
		Korea’s launch, according to his office.</p>
	
	<p>A communique from the NATO meeting on Tuesday urged North Korea
		to abandoned its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs, which
		are in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions
		banning them.</p>
	<p>“We call on (North Korea) to accept the repeated offers of
		dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including Japan, the
		United States, and the Republic of Korea,” the communique said.</p>
	<p>But North Korea has shown no signs that it is willing to engage
		in negotiations with Washington or Seoul.</p>
	<p>Wednesday’s ICBM test follows threats from Kim Yo Jong, a senior
		North Korean official and sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un,
		who accused a US spy plane of entering the North’s exclusive economic
		zone at least eight times on Monday.</p>
	<p>“In case of repeated illegal intrusion, the US forces will
		experience a very critical flight,” Kim warned in a statement Tuesday
		from North Korea’s state news agency.</p>
	<p>The US and South Korea dismissed the accusations and urged North
		Korea to stop creating tension with false claims.</p>
	<p>Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies
		at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said that Kim’s accusations are
		part of a North Korean pattern of inflating external threats to rally
		domestic support and justify weapons tests.</p>
	<p>“Pyongyang also times its shows of force to disrupt what it
		perceives as diplomatic coordination against it, in this case, South
		Korea and Japan’s leaders meeting during the NATO summit,” said
		Easley.</p>

	<p>Last month, tens of thousands of North Koreans marched in
		anti-US rallies in Pyongyang, marking the 73rd anniversary of the
		start of the Korean War. The participants denounced the US as
		“Destroyer of peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula” and warned
		of nuclear war, according to state nedia.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, South Korea, the US and Japan have been holding joint
		and trilateral military exercises aimed at deterring any North Korean
		military threat.</p>
	<p>Wednesday’s launch comes two weeks before North Korea is due to
		celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement, that
		brought about a cessation of hostilities of the Korean War, and weeks
		after its failed launch of the first spy satellite in May.</p>
